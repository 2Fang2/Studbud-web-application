# The Studbud web application<br> written by Fang Ma</h1>
Studbud is mainly designed for the target group of online international students with poor memory and review, who may be 22-30 years old, but this can also include other students who are not independent in their learning. For the functionality of this web page, it is mainly divided into five parts, namely: Home page, Calendar page, Reading list page, Tools page and flashcards page. Comparing A2's Web App prototype and some feedback from the tutorial, I changed some ideas and added important details in this website design.
# What contents would I discuss next?
  * Comparison：I will explain the change between previous web prototype and the current prototype.
  * Design principles: The 4 main design . 
  * How I overcome to these challenges. 
  * References.
## 1.Comparison
The first is to introduce some comments and feedback about my A2's design and final design through Tutor. In fact, the main change is the navigation bar and the layout of each page, and only some details are added for the main function, and some unnecessary secondary design elements are removed.
### Home page
![This is the original prototype for the home page](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Home%20page.png)
![This is the current prototype for the home page ](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Home.png)
Regarding the change of the home page, I changed the former home page into a task page. I think a good start page can directly help target users know what their tasks are today. Regarding this homepage or task page, users can edit, add and delete their own tasks, and know the priority of tasks through editing. And the design in the upper right corner of the page lets users know what the tasks are for today. In addition, I moved the navigation bar of Studbud to the left side of the web page. The side navigation bar can make the user feel that the whole page looks more clear and tidy, and it is also easier to store and manage. In order to match the mobile terminal, I added an icon in the upper right corner, The navigation bar on the left only appears when the user clicks on the icon.
### Calendar page
![This is the original prototype for the home page](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Calendar%20page.png)
![This is the current prototype for the home page ](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Calendar.png)
Regarding the calendar page, I changed the previous complex function to a simple function, because the main function of the calendar is to show what the tasks of each day are, so I inserted a small calendar, when the user clicks on a date of a day, it  will show you what the task for the day is. In short, this function can better help users understand the daily task situation, and this page is very good for assigning tasks created by users to a specified day.
### Reading list page
![This is the original prototype for the home page](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Reading%20list%20page.png)
![This is the current prototype for the home page ](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Reading%20list.png)
To help users better summarize their daily learning materials, I also inserted a small calendar. Regarding how to store links, users only need to copy the link of the article or other website directly into the Add Link option, and click the "Add Link" button to store the link. After saving, there are two buttons in the upper right corner of the page, namely: Save and Open. When the user clicks the "Open" button, the user can open all the links at one time instead of opening the links one by one.
### Tools page
![This is the original prototype for the home page](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Tools.png)
![This is the current prototype for the home page ](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Web%201920%20%E2%80%93%203.png)
Regarding the flashcards page, this is a new page that I added through A2tutor's evaluation of my design, because the feedback from the tutor to me at that time was that the target users were vague, so this time I added the flashcards page, which is specially to help those who need to review It is specially prepared by online students, which may also be a very important function of this website. Regarding its function, users can create questions and answers. After creating, some corresponding memory cards will appear. When the user finishes speaking the answer, the user can click on the card, and the answer will appear on the card, and then the user can check and review by himself through the question. Case.
### Flashcards page
![This is the current prototype for the home page](https://github.com/2Fang2/Studbud-fama6246/blob/master/Web%20mockups/Flashcards.png)
Regarding the flashcards page, this is a new page that I added through A2tutor's evaluation of my design, because the feedback from the tutor at the time was that the target users were vague, so this time I added the flashcards page, which is a special line to help review. It was specially prepared by the last classmates, which may also be a very important function of this website. Regarding its function, users can create questions and answers. After creating, some corresponding memory cards will appear. When the user finishes speaking the answer, the user can click on the card, and the answer will appear on the card, and then the user can check and review by himself through the question.
## 2.Design principles
* The first design principle is __Color__. Color is very important in web design because it catches the user's eye the first time and can also reflect the overall feel of the design. So the colors I chose for this website design are blue, pink and white. I use this blue for the navigation bar and some buttons because blue can represent innovation, safety and trust. From a design perspective, blue is more practical and friendly to people who are colorblind. Plus, this utilitarian cool shade of blue and lively warm shade of pink lends a cosy feel.
* The second design principle is __alignment__, Regarding the layout, I mostly use the centered and left-aligned typesetting methods, among which the left-aligned is the most efficient alignment method for reading, which can better adapt to the habits of the human eye, because people read text from left to right. . And about center alignment, it can guide the visual flow and make the web page more brief and organized.
* The third design principle is   __Legibility__. Legibility is characterized by font size and typeface. So for this design I used Roboto, which is described as a modern, approachable and emotional typeface, this typeface is very clean but modern in web pages, so it is very suitable for this web application.
* The third design principle is   __Consistency__. Consistency is also important in design, as some similar parts can improve the usability of a website. Regarding aesthetics, the style of this website is unified, and it increases the recognizability of the design. Regarding the functions, there are many functions that people can use the knowledge they have learned to understand the use functions of this website.
## 3.Feedback
At the end, I built a relatively complete web application through some Youtube and website learning. My assessment from A2 tutor was about details and functional issues, so in this final assessment, I focused on these two issues and added additional special features (flashcards page) for this specific type of student. Although most of the functions have been implemented, there are still some areas that need to be improved. For example, the website may lack some fun, or next time I may make the website more innovative or technological. All in all, I think this website design is a big challenge for me. It took me a long time to build it, so there are some problems, I hope I can improve it better in the future. Finally, thank you for watching the webpage I designed, and I hope someone can point out some areas for improvement.
